# 02443 Simulation of Epidemics

This repo contains the created scripts and notebooks used for the exam project in course 02443 Stochastic Simulation at DTU.

The `src`-folder contains two scripts:

1) `classes.py` where all the comparmental models are implemented.
2) `visualize.py` where all the plots for the different compartmental models are created.

The `notebook`-folder contains three python notebooks:

1) `Corona.ipynb` where the code for creating the Corona simulations are done.
2) `Ebola.ipynb` where the code for creating the Ebola simulations are done.
3) `Plague.ipynb` where the code for creating the Plague simulations are done.

The `report`-folder contains the actual report as well as a sub-folder with all the figures.
